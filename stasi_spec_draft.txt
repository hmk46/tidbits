Shorthand Textbook specificAtion notatIon (stasi)

general syntax: spec[;spec2[;...;specN]]

specifier syntax: pspec:qspec

Page and question specifiers use the following selection operators for determining their ranges, listed in ascending order of precedence:

comma (,): union operator; used to join two non-contiguous ranges
	example: 29:3,12,17

hyphen (-): range operator; used for specifying the boundaries of a contiguous range; inclusive on both ends.
	example: 25-28:1,4,8-11,19,31-42

slash (/): exclusion operator; used to exclude a subordinate item from a selection.
	example: 32:3/d,4-6/V

All the selection operators are left-associative. Operators may be repeated multiple times to elevate their precedence. Elevated operators will have a precedence greater than all operators with a lower elevation level, but maintain the same precedence order relative to their own elevation level.
For example, the specifier
	2-7/c
denotes a range from question 2 to 7, excluding section c from question 7;
the specifier
	2--7/c
denotes a range from question 2 to 7, excluding section c from all of them;
and the specifier
	2//a---D--7/c,,e
denotes a range from question 2 to 7, excluding sections a to d from question 2 and sections c and e from all of them.
